Day 1: Core Features (Student Management and Attendance)
1. Student Dashboard:

Create a dashboard where the admin can see all the students, their attendance, subscription status, and reserved seat info.
Implement search and filter functionality (e.g., by shift, subscription status).
Display a list of students with key information (name, address, mobile, shift, etc.).
2. Attendance Marking:

Implement a feature to mark attendance for students. This could be a simple checkbox or button next to each student that marks their attendance for the day.
Record the attendance in the database (create an attendance field or a separate collection with student references).
Optionally, allow admins to view past attendance records.
3. Subscription and Reserved Seat Management:

Implement a feature for the admin to update the subscriptionEndDate for each student, indicating when their subscription expires.
Add logic to automatically check if a student's subscription is active or expired based on the subscriptionEndDate.
Allow the admin to update the reserved seat status as well.



Day 2: Authentication, Authorization, and UI Improvements
4. Admin Authorization (Role-based access control):

Ensure that the admin can only access the dashboard if authenticated and authorized.
You may want to implement role-based access control (e.g., multiple roles with different permissions) if needed, or ensure that admin can only access certain routes after login.
5. Add More UI Functionality:

Improve the UI using a CSS framework like TailwindCSS (if not done already) to make the app user-friendly and responsive.
Create modal dialogs for adding/editing students or updating attendance.
Make the app more interactive by adding forms for creating new students and editing existing student details.
6. Error Handling and Validation:

Ensure that all forms have proper client-side and server-side validation (e.g., ensuring all required fields are filled out).
Implement error handling (e.g., if an admin tries to add a student without providing all fields, show a meaningful error message).
Day 3: Testing, Optimization, and Final Touches
7. Testing:

Thoroughly test the application for bugs, especially for the core features like student addition, attendance marking, and subscription management.
Test edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, empty fields, expired subscriptions).
Test the application on different browsers and devices to ensure itâ€™s responsive.
8. Optimize Performance:

Ensure the backend API is efficient, with appropriate indexing in MongoDB for frequently queried fields (e.g., student name, shift).
Check if any unnecessary data is being fetched and optimize the queries.
9. Prepare for Deployment:

If your app is ready for deployment, consider deploying it using a service like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or Vercel.
Configure environment variables for production (e.g., database connection, JWT secret).
Ensure that all static files (e.g., CSS, JS) are served correctly in production.
10. Final Review:

Review the entire application, ensuring that all the required features are implemented.
Check the user experience (UX) to ensure the app is intuitive for the library owner.
Make sure your code is clean and well-documented.
Additional Suggestions:
Optional Feature: Student Search and Reporting:
Allow the admin to search for students by name, address, or shift and generate reports (e.g., attendance report for the past month).
Optional Feature: Notifications:
Implement a feature to notify the admin about subscription expirations or upcoming dates for students.
